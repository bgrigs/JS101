// What will the following two lines of code output? Don't look at the solution before you answer.

console.log(0.3 + 0.6);
console.log(0.3 + 0.6 === 0.9);

// JavaScript uses floating point numbers for all numeric operations.
// Most floating point representations used on computers lack a certain amount of precision, and that can yield unexpected results like these.

/* In this case, the output was:
0.8999999999999999
false */
